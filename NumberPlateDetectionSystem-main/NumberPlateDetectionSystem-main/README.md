# NumberPlateDetectionSystem
## Objective
To detect Number Plate in images using a YOLO-based deep learning model.

## Dataset
Roboflow License Plate Dataset (YOLO format)

## Methodology
- Dataset preprocessing and annotation
- YOLO model training using transfer learning
- Model evaluation on validation images
- Gradio interface for real-time detection

## Results
The trained model successfully detects number plate with high accuracy.

## How to Run
